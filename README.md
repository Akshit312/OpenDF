[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scorelab/OpenDF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scorelab/OpenDF)

Nowadays, digital forensic tools are often used to investigate cyber crimes, which are becoming more and more frequent. In the world of digital forensics, the more powerful the tool is, the easier it is to gather evidence. SCoRE aims to develop a powerful digital forensics tool through OpenDF, using the power of cloud computing to enable investigators to mine evidence more effectively and generate reports more successfully.
